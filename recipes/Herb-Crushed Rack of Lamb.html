    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lamb rack is one of those things that always seems fancy, but the truth is that it's actually so easy, and hard to mess up. This version is super simple and classic. The timing in the recipe yields pink, juicy, medium-rare meat, but you can of course cook it longer/to a higher temperature if preferred. Perfect for your Easter lunch, or as an impressive part of any special occasion meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup italian parsley leaves</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 (1 pound) frenched racks of lamb, at room temperature, trimmed of excess fat</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, parsley, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, mint, rosemary, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and lemon zest in the bowl of a food processor. Process until well combined, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a shallow dish and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high. Pat lamb dry with paper towels. Season with black pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Add lamb to skillet and cook until browned on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes total</li>
        <li>Brush the lamb with mustard, then dip and roll into prepared bread crumb mixture to coat, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
        <li>Place lamb on the prepared rack, meat side up, with the bones pointed towards the middle of the rack.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer registers 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for medium-rare, about 20 minutes, or to desired degree of doneness. Tent loosely with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing in between the bones. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
